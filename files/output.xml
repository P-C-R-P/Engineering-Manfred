        <speech> The lamp must be replenished, but even then
</speech>
        <speech>    It will not burn so long as I must watch:
</speech>
        <speech>    My slumbers--if I slumber--are not sleep,
</speech>
        <speech>    But a continuance, of enduring thought,
</speech>
        <speech>    Which then I can resist not: in my heart
</speech>
        <speech>    There is a vigil, and these eyes but close
</speech>
        <speech>    To look within; and yet I live, and bear
</speech>
        <speech>    The aspect and the form of breathing men.
</speech>
        <speech>    But Grief should be the Instructor of the wise;
</speech>
        <speech>    Sorrow is Knowledge: they who know the most                         10
</speech>
        <speech>    Must mourn the deepest o'er the fatal truth,
</speech>
        <speech>    The Tree of Knowledge is not that of Life.
</speech>
        <speech>    Philosophy and science, and the springs
</speech>
        <speech>    Of Wonder, and the wisdom of the World,
</speech>
        <speech>    I have essayed, and in my mind there is
</speech>
        <speech>    A power to make these subject to itself--
</speech>
        <speech>    But they avail not: I have done men good,
</speech>
        <speech>    And I have met with good even among men--
</speech>
        <speech>    But this availed not: I have had my foes,
</speech>
        <speech>    And none have baffled, many fallen before me--                      20
</speech>
        <speech>    But this availed not:--Good--or evil--life--
</speech>
        <speech>    Powers, passions--all I see in other beings,
</speech>
        <speech>    Have been to me as rain unto the sands,
</speech>
        <speech>    Since that all-nameless hour. I have no dread,
</speech>
        <speech>    And feel the curse to have no natural fear,
</speech>
        <speech>    Nor fluttering throb, that beats with hopes or wishes,
</speech>
        <speech>    Or lurking love of something on the earth.
</speech>
        <speech>    Now to my task.--
</speech>
        <speech>                     Mysterious Agency!
</speech>
        <speech>    Ye Spirits of the unbounded Universe!
</speech>
        <speech>    Whom I have sought in darkness and in light--                       30
</speech>
        <speech>    Ye, who do compass earth about, and dwell
</speech>
        <speech>    In subtler essence--ye, to whom the tops
</speech>
        <speech>    Of mountains inaccessible are haunts,
</speech>
        <speech>    And Earth's and Ocean's caves familiar things--
</speech>
        <speech>    I call upon ye by the written charm
</speech>
        <speech>    Which gives me power upon you--Rise! Appear!
</speech>
        <stage>                                                                 [A pause.]</stage>
        <speech>    They come not yet.--Now by the voice of him
</speech>
        <speech>    Who is the first among you--by this sign,
</speech>
        <speech>    Which makes you tremble--by the claims of him
</speech>
        <speech>    Who is undying,--Rise! Appear!----Appear!                           40
</speech>
        <stage>                                                                 [A pause.]</stage>
        <speech>    If it be so.--Spirits of Earth and Air,
</speech>
        <speech>    Ye shall not so elude me! By a power,
</speech>
        <speech>    Deeper than all yet urged, a tyrant-spell,
</speech>
        <speech>    Which had its birthplace in a star condemned,
</speech>
        <speech>    The burning wreck of a demolished world,
</speech>
        <speech>    A wandering hell in the eternal Space;
</speech>
        <speech>    By the strong curse which is upon my Soul,
</speech>
        <speech>    The thought which is within me and around me,
</speech>
        <speech>    I do compel ye to my will.--Appear!
</speech>
        <speech>         [A star is seen at the darker end of the gallery: it is
</speech>
        <speech>               stationary; and a voice is heard singing.]

        <speech>      Mortal! to thy bidding bowed,                                     50
</speech>
        <speech>      From my mansion in the cloud,
</speech>
        <speech>      Which the breath of Twilight builds,
</speech>
        <speech>      And the Summer's sunset gilds
</speech>
        <speech>      With the azure and vermilion,
</speech>
        <speech>      Which is mixed for my pavilion;
</speech>
        <speech>      Though thy quest may be forbidden,
</speech>
        <speech>      On a star-beam I have ridden,
</speech>
        <speech>      To thine adjuration bowed:

        <speech>      Mortal--be thy wish avowed!

        <speech>    Mont Blanc is the Monarch of mountains;                             60
</speech>
        <speech>      They crowned him long ago
</speech>
        <speech>    On a throne of rocks, in a robe of clouds,
</speech>
        <speech>      With a Diadem of snow.
</speech>
        <speech>    Around his waist are forests braced,
</speech>
        <speech>      The Avalanche in his hand;
</speech>
        <speech>    But ere it fall, that thundering ball
</speech>
        <speech>      Must pause for my command.
</speech>
        <speech>    The Glacier's cold and restless mass
</speech>
        <speech>      Moves onward day by day;
</speech>
        <speech>    But I am he who bids it pass,                                       70
</speech>
        <speech>      Or with its ice delay.
</speech>
        <speech>    I am the Spirit of the place,
</speech>
        <speech>      Could make the mountain bow
</speech>
        <speech>    And quiver to his caverned base--
</speech>
        <speech>      And what with me would'st Thou?
</speech>
        <speaker name="THIRD SPIRIT">                        THIRD SPIRIT.</speaker>
        <speech>    In the blue depth of the waters,
</speech>
        <speech>      Where the wave hath no strife,
</speech>
        <speech>    Where the Wind is a stranger,
</speech>
        <speech>      And the Sea-snake hath life,
</speech>
        <speech>    Where the Mermaid is decking                                        80
</speech>
        <speech>      Her green hair with shells,
</speech>
        <speech>    Like the storm on the surface
</speech>
        <speech>      Came the sound of thy spells;
</speech>
        <speech>    O'er my calm Hall of Coral
</speech>
        <speech>      The deep Echo rolled--
</speech>
        <speech>    To the Spirit of Ocean
</speech>
        <speech>      Thy wishes unfold!
</speech>
        <speech>                              FOURTH SPIRIT.
</speech>
        <speech>    Where the slumbering Earthquake
</speech>
        <speech>      Lies pillowed on fire,
</speech>
        <speech>    And the lakes of bitumen                                            90
</speech>
        <speech>      Rise boilingly higher;
</speech>
        <speech>    Where the roots of the Andes
</speech>
        <speech>      Strike deep in the earth,
</speech>
        <speech>    As their summits to heaven
</speech>
        <speech>      Shoot soaringly forth;
</speech>
        <speech>    I have quitted my birthplace,
</speech>
        <speech>      Thy bidding to bide--
</speech>
        <speech>    Thy spell hath subdued me,
</speech>
        <speech>      Thy will be my guide!
</speech>
        <speech>                              FIFTH SPIRIT.
</speech>
        <speech>    I am the Rider of the wind,                                        100
</speech>
        <speech>      The Stirrer of the storm;
</speech>
        <speech>    The hurricane I left behind
</speech>
        <speech>      Is yet with lightning warm;
</speech>
        <speech>    To speed to thee, o'er shore and sea
</speech>
        <speech>      I swept upon the blast:
</speech>
        <speech>    The fleet I met sailed well--and yet
</speech>
        <speech>      'Twill sink ere night be past.
</speech>
        <speech>                              SIXTH SPIRIT.
</speech>
        <speech>    My dwelling is the shadow of the Night,
</speech>
        <speech>    Why doth thy magic torture me with light?
</speech>
        <speech>                             SEVENTH SPIRIT.
</speech>
        <speech>    The Star which rules thy destiny no                                110
</speech>
        <speech>    Was ruled, ere earth began, by me:
</speech>
        <speech>    It was a World as fresh and fair
</speech>
        <speech>    As e'er revolved round Sun in air;
</speech>
        <speech>    Its course was free and regular,
</speech>
        <speech>    Space bosomed not a lovelier star.
</speech>
        <speech>    The Hour arrived--and it became
</speech>
        <speech>    A wandering mass of shapeless flame,
</speech>
        <speech>    A pathless Comet, and a curse,
</speech>
        <speech>    The menace of the Universe;
</speech>
        <speech>    Still rolling on with innate force,                                120
</speech>
        <speech>    Without a sphere, without a course,
</speech>
        <speech>    A bright deformity on high,
</speech>
        <speech>    The monster of the upper sky!
</speech>
        <speech>    And Thou! beneath its influence born--
</speech>
        <speech>    Thou worm! whom I obey and scorn--
</speech>
        <speech>    Forced by a Power (which is not thine,
</speech>
        <speech>    And lent thee but to make thee mine)
</speech>
        <speech>    For this brief moment to descend,
</speech>
        <speech>    Where these weak Spirits round thee bend
</speech>
        <speech>    And parley with a thing like thee--                                130
</speech>
        <speech>    What would'st thou, Child of Clay! with me?
</speech>
        <speech>                           The SEVEN SPIRITS.
</speech>
        <speech>    Earth--ocean--air--night--mountains--winds--thy Star,
</speech>
        <speech>      Are at thy beck and bidding, Child of Clay!
</speech>
        <speech>    Before thee at thy quest their Spirits are--
</speech>
        <speech>      What would'st thou with us, Son of mortals--say?
</speech>
        <speaker name="MANFRED">     MANFRED.</speaker>
        <speech> Forgetfulness----
</speech>
        <speaker name="FIRST SPIRIT">     FIRST SPIRIT.</speaker>
        <speech>            Of what--of whom--and why?
</speech>
        <speaker name="MANFRED">     MANFRED.</speaker>
        <speech> Of that which is within me; read it there--
</speech>
        <speech>    Ye know it--and I cannot utter it.
</speech>
        <speaker name="SPIRIT">     SPIRIT.</speaker>
        <speech> We can but give thee that which we possess:
</speech>
        <speech>    Ask of us subjects, sovereignty, the power                         140
</speech>
        <speech>    O'er earth--the whole, or portion--or a sign
</speech>
        <speech>    Which shall control the elements, whereof
</speech>
        <speech>    We are the dominators,--each and all,
</speech>
        <speech>    These shall be thine.
</speech>
        <speaker name="MANFRED">     MANFRED.</speaker>
        <speech>                Oblivion--self-oblivion!
</speech>
        <speech>    Can ye not wring from out the hidden realms
</speech>
        <speech>    Ye offer so profusely--what I ask?
</speech>
        <speaker name="SPIRIT">     SPIRIT.</speaker>
        <speech> It is not in our essence, in our skill;
</speech>
        <speech>    But--thou may'st die.
</speech>
        <speaker name="MANFRED">     MANFRED.</speaker>
        <speech>                Will Death bestow it on me?
</speech>
        <speaker name="SPIRIT">     SPIRIT.</speaker>
        <speech> We are immortal, and do not forget;
</speech>
        <speech>    We are eternal; and to us the past                                 150
</speech>
        <speech>    Is, as the future, present. Art thou answered?
</speech>
        <speaker name="MANFRED">     MANFRED.</speaker>
        <speech> Ye mock me--but the Power which brought ye here
</speech>
        <speech>    Hath made you mine. Slaves, scoff not at my will!
</speech>
        <speech>    The Mind--the Spirit--the Promethean spark,
</speech>
        <speech>    The lightning of my being, is as bright,
</speech>
        <speech>    Pervading, and far darting as your own,
</speech>
        <speech>    And shall not yield to yours, though cooped in clay!
</speech>
        <speech>    Answer, or I will teach you what I am.
</speech>
        <speaker name="SPIRIT">     SPIRIT.</speaker>
        <speech> We answer--as we answered; our reply
</speech>
        <speech>    Is even in thine own words.
</speech>
        <speaker name="MANFRED">     MANFRED.</speaker>
        <speech>                      Why say ye so?                         160
</speech>
        <speaker name="SPIRIT">     SPIRIT.</speaker>
        <speech> If, as thou say'st, thine essence be as ours,
</speech>
        <speech>    We have replied in telling thee, the thing
</speech>
        <speech>    Mortals call death hath nought to do with us.
</speech>
        <speaker name="MANFRED">     MANFRED.</speaker>
        <speech> I then have called ye from your realms in vain;
</speech>
        <speech>    Ye cannot, or ye will not, aid me.
</speech>
        <speaker name="SPIRIT">     SPIRIT.</speaker>
        <speech>                         Say--
</speech>
        <speech>    What we possess we offer; it is thine:
</speech>
        <speech>    Bethink ere thou dismiss us; ask again;
</speech>
        <speech>    Kingdom, and sway, and strength, and length of days--
</speech>
        <speaker name="MANFRED">     MANFRED.</speaker>
        <speech> Accurséd! what have I to do with days?
</speech>
        <speech>    They are too long already.--Hence--begone!                         170
</speech>
        <speaker name="SPIRIT">     SPIRIT.</speaker>
        <speech> Yet pause: being here, our will would do thee service;
</speech>
        <speech>    Bethink thee, is there then no other gift
</speech>
        <speech>    Which we can make not worthless in thine eyes?
</speech>
        <speaker name="MANFRED">     MANFRED.</speaker>
        <speech> No, none: yet stay--one moment, ere we part,
</speech>
        <speech>    I would behold ye face to face. I hear
</speech>
        <speech>    Your voices, sweet and melancholy sounds,
</speech>
        <speech>    As Music on the waters; and I see
</speech>
        <speech>    The steady aspect of a clear large Star;
</speech>
        <speech>    But nothing more. Approach me as ye are,
</speech>
        <speech>    Or one--or all--in your accustomed forms.                          180
</speech>
        <speaker name="SPIRIT">     SPIRIT.</speaker>
        <speech> We have no forms, beyond the elements
</speech>
        <speech>    Of which we are the mind and principle:
</speech>
        <speech>    But choose a form--in that we will appear.
</speech>
        <speaker name="MANFRED">     MANFRED.</speaker>
        <speech> I have no choice; there is no form on earth
</speech>
        <speech>    Hideous or beautiful to me. Let him,
</speech>
        <speech>    Who is most powerful of ye, take such aspect
</speech>
        <speech>    As unto him may seem most fitting--Come!
</speech>
        <speech>    Seventh Spirit (appearing in the shape of a beautiful
</speech>
        <speech>    female figure). Behold!
</speech>
        <speaker name="MANFRED">     MANFRED.</speaker>
        <speech>        Oh God! if it be thus, and thou
</speech>
        <speech>    Art not a madness and a mockery,
</speech>
        <speech>    I yet might be most happy. I will clasp thee,                      190
</speech>
        <speech>    And we again will be----

        <stage>                                                   [The figure vanishes.]</stage>
        <speech>                            My heart is crushed!

        <speech>        When the Moon is on the wave,
</speech>
        <speech>          And the glow-worm in the grass,
</speech>
        <speech>        And the meteor on the grave,

        <speech>          And the wisp on the morass;

        <speech>        When the falling stars are shooting,

        <speech>        In the shadow of the hill,

        <speech>        With a power and with a sign.
</speech>
        <speech>        Though thy slumber may be deep,

        <speech>        Yet thy Spirit shall not sleep;
</speech>
        <speech>        There are shades which will not vanish,
</speech>
        <speech>        There are thoughts thou canst not banish;
</speech>
        <speech>        By a Power to thee unknown,
</speech>
        <speech>        Thou canst never be alone;
</speech>
        <speech>        Thou art wrapt as with a shroud,
</speech>
        <speech>        Thou art gathered in a cloud;
</speech>
        <speech>        And for ever shalt thou dwell                                  210
</speech>
        <speech>        In the spirit of this spell.
</speech>
        <speech>        Though thou seest me not pass by,
</speech>
        <speech>        Thou shalt feel me with thine eye
</speech>
        <speech>        As a thing that, though unseen,
</speech>
        <speech>        Must be near thee, and hath been;
</speech>
        <speech>        And when in that secret dread
</speech>
        <speech>        Thou hast turned around thy head,
</speech>
        <speech>        Thou shalt marvel I am not
</speech>
        <speech>        As thy shadow on the spot,
</speech>
        <speech>        And the power which thou dost feel                             220
</speech>
        <speech>        Shall be what thou must conceal.
</speech>
        <speech>        And a magic voice and verse
</speech>
        <speech>        Hath baptized thee with a curse;
</speech>
        <speech>        And a Spirit of the air
</speech>
        <speech>        Hath begirt thee with a snare;
</speech>
        <speech>        In the wind there is a voice
</speech>
        <speech>        Shall forbid thee to rejoice;
</speech>
        <speech>        And to thee shall Night deny
</speech>
        <speech>        All the quiet of her sky;
</speech>
        <speech>        And the day shall have a sun,                                  230
</speech>
        <speech>        Which shall make thee wish it done.
</speech>
        <speech>        From thy false tears I did distil
</speech>
        <speech>        An essence which hath strength to kill;
</speech>
        <speech>        From thy own heart I then did wring
</speech>
        <speech>        The black blood in its blackest spring;
</speech>
        <speech>        From thy own smile I snatched the snake,
</speech>
        <speech>        For there it coiled as in a brake;
</speech>
        <speech>        From thy own lip I drew the charm
</speech>
        <speech>        Which gave all these their chiefest harm;
</speech>
        <speech>        In proving every poison known,                                 240
</speech>
        <speech>        I found the strongest was thine own.
</speech>
        <speech>        By the cold breast and serpent smile,
</speech>
        <speech>        By thy unfathomed gulfs of guile,
</speech>
        <speech>        By that most seeming virtuous eye,
</speech>
        <speech>        By thy shut soul's hypocrisy;
</speech>
        <speech>        By the perfection of thine art
</speech>
        <speech>        Which passed for human thine own heart;
</speech>
        <speech>        By thy delight in others' pain,
</speech>
        <speech>        And by thy brotherhood of Cain,
</speech>
        <speech>        I call upon thee! and compel                               250
</speech>
        <speech>        Thyself to be thy proper Hell!
</speech>
        <speech>        And on thy head I pour the vial
</speech>
        <speech>        Which doth devote thee to this trial;
</speech>
        <speech>        Nor to slumber, nor to die,
</speech>
        <speech>        Shall be in thy destiny;
</speech>
        <speech>        Though thy death shall still seem near
</speech>
        <speech>        To thy wish, but as a fear;
</speech>
        <speech>        Lo! the spell now works around thee,
</speech>
        <speech>        And the clankless chain hath bound thee;
</speech>
        <speech>        O'er thy heart and brain together                              260

        <speech> I say 'tis blood--my blood! the pure warm stream
</speech>

</speech>
        <speech>    When we were in our youth, and had one heart,

</speech>
        <speech>    My joys--my griefs--my passions--and my powers,
</speech>
        <speech>    Made me a stranger; though I wore the form,
</speech>
        <speech>    I had no sympathy with breathing flesh,
</speech>
        <speech>    Nor midst the Creatures of Clay that girded me
</speech>
        <speech>    Was there but One who--but of her anon.
</speech>
        <speech>    I said with men, and with the thoughts of men,                      60
</speech>
        <speech>    I held but slight communion; but instead,
</speech>
        <speech>    My joy was in the wilderness,--to breathe
</speech>
        <speech>    The difficult air of the iced mountain's top,
</speech>
        <speech>    Where the birds dare not build--nor insect's wing
</speech>
        <speech>    Flit o'er the herbless granite; or to plunge
</speech>
        <speech>    Into the torrent, and to roll along
</speech>
        <speech>    On the swift whirl of the new-breaking wave
</speech>
        <speech>    Of river-stream, or Ocean, in their flow.
</speech>
        <speech>    In these my early strength exulted; or
</speech>
        <speech>    To follow through the night the moving moon,                   70
</speech>
        <speech>    The stars and their development; or catch
</speech>
        <speech>    The dazzling lightnings till my eyes grew dim;
</speech>
        <speech>    Or to look, list'ning, on the scattered leaves,
</speech>
        <speech>    While Autumn winds were at their evening song.
</speech>
        <speech>    These were my pastimes, and to be alone;
</speech>
        <speech>    For if the beings, of whom I was one,--
</speech>
        <speech>    Hating to be so,--crossed me in my path,
</speech>
        <speech>    I felt myself degraded back to them,
</speech>
        <speech>    And was all clay again. And then I dived,
</speech>
        <speech>    In my lone wanderings, to the caves of Death,                       80
</speech>
        <speech>    Searching its cause in its effect; and drew
</speech>
        <speech>    From withered bones, and skulls, and heaped up dust
</speech>
        <speech>    Conclusions most forbidden. Then I passed--
</speech>
        <speech>    The nights of years in sciences untaught,
</speech>
        <speech>    Save in the old-time; and with time and toil,
</speech>
        <speech>    And terrible ordeal, and such penance
</speech>
        <speech>    As in itself hath power upon the air,
</speech>
        <speech>    And spirits that do compass air and earth,
</speech>
        <speech>    Space, and the peopled Infinite, I made
</speech>
        <speech>    Mine eyes familiar with Eternity,                                   90
</speech>
        <speech>    Such as, before me, did the Magi, and

</speech>
        <speech>    Eros and Anteros, at Gadara,
</speech>
        <speech>    As I do thee;--and with my knowledge grew
</speech>
        <speech>    The thirst of knowledge, and the power and joy

        <speech>    Of this most bright intelligence, until----

</speech>
        <speech>    As I approach the core of my heart's grief--

</speech>
        <speech>    Father or mother, mistress, friend, or being,

</speech>
        <speech>    If I had such, they seemed not such to me--

        <speech> She was like me in lineaments--her eyes--
</speech>
        <speech>    Her hair--her features--all, to the very tone
</speech>
        <speech>    Even of her voice, they said were like to mine;
</speech>
        <speech>    But softened all, and tempered into beauty:
</speech>
        <speech>    She had the same lone thoughts and wanderings,
</speech>
        <speech>    The quest of hidden knowledge, and a mind                          110

        <speech>    To comprehend the Universe: nor these
</speech>

        <speech>    Pity, and smiles, and tears--which I had not;

        <speech>    And tenderness--but that I had for her;
</speech>
        <speech>    Humility--and that I never had.
</speech>
        <speech>    Her faults were mine--her virtues were her own--

        <speech> Not with my hand, but heart, which broke her heart;
</speech>
        <speech>    It gazed on mine, and withered. I have shed
</speech>
        <speech>    Blood, but not hers--and yet her blood was shed;                   120
</speech>
        <speech>    I saw--and could not stanch it.

        <speaker name="WITCH">     WITCH.</speaker>
        <speech>                         And for this--

        <speech>    A being of the race thou dost despise--
</speech>

        <speech>    Or watch my watchings--Come and sit by me!

        <speech>    My teeth in darkness till returning morn,

        <speech>    I have affronted Death--but in the war

        <speech>    Relate me some to while away our watch:

        <speech>    I've heard thee darkly speak of an event

        <speech>That was a night indeed! I do remember
</speech>
        <speech>    'Twas twilight, as it may be now, and such
</speech>
        <speech>    Another evening:--yon red cloud, which rests
</speech>
        <speech>    On Eigher's pinnacle, so rested then,--
</speech>
        <speech>    So like that it might be the same; the wind
</speech>
        <speech>    Was faint and gusty, and the mountain snows
</speech>
        <speech>    Began to glitter with the climbing moon;                            40
</speech>
        <speech>    Count Manfred was, as now, within his tower,--
</speech>
        <speech>    How occupied, we knew not, but with him
</speech>
        <speech>    The sole companion of his wanderings
</speech>
        <speech>    And watchings--her, whom of all earthly things

        <speech>    As he, indeed, by blood was bound to do,

        <speech>    Of the snow-shining mountains.--Beautiful!
</speech>
        <speech>    I linger yet with Nature, for the Night

        <speech>    Hath been to me a more familiar face

        <speech>    Of dim and solitary loveliness,

        <speech>    I learned the language of another world.

        <speech>    I do remember me, that in my youth,
</speech>
        <speech>    When I was wandering,--upon such a night
</speech>
        <speech>    I stood within the Coliseum's wall,                            10
</speech>
        <speech>    'Midst the chief relics of almighty Rome;
</speech>
        <speech>    The trees which grew along the broken arches
</speech>
        <speech>    Waved dark in the blue midnight, and the stars
</speech>
        <speech>    Shone through the rents of ruin; from afar
</speech>
        <speech>    The watch-dog bayed beyond the Tiber; and
</speech>
        <speech>    More near from out the Cæsars' palace came
</speech>
        <speech>    The owl's long cry, and, interruptedly,
</speech>
        <speech>    Of distant sentinels the fitful song
</speech>
        <speech>    Begun and died upon the gentle wind.

        <speech>    Some cypresses beyond the time-worn breach                          20
</speech>
        <speech>    Appeared to skirt the horizon, yet they stood
</speech>
        <speech>    Within a bowshot. Where the Cæsars dwelt,
</speech>
        <speech>    And dwell the tuneless birds of night, amidst
</speech>
        <speech>    A grove which springs through levelled battlements,
</speech>
        <speech>    And twines its roots with the imperial hearths,

        <speech>    Ivy usurps the laurel's place of growth;

        <speech>    But the gladiators' bloody Circus stands,

        <speech>    All this, and cast a wide and tender light,

        <speech>    Which softened down the hoar austerity

        <speech> Alas! how pale thou art--thy lips are white--
</speech>
        <speech>    And thy breast heaves--and in thy gasping throat

        <speech>    The accents rattle: Give thy prayers to Heaven--

        <speech>    Pray--albeit but in thought,--but die not thus.
