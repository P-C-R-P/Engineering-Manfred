                                  ACT I.



      SCENE I.--Manfred alone.--Scene, a Gothic Gallery.--

                            Time, Midnight.



     MANFRED.
 The lamp must be replenished, but even then

    It will not burn so long as I must watch:

    My slumbers--if I slumber--are not sleep,

    But a continuance, of enduring thought,

    Which then I can resist not: in my heart

    There is a vigil, and these eyes but close

    To look within; and yet I live, and bear

    The aspect and the form of breathing men.

    But Grief should be the Instructor of the wise;

    Sorrow is Knowledge: they who know the most                         10

    Must mourn the deepest o'er the fatal truth,

    The Tree of Knowledge is not that of Life.

    Philosophy and science, and the springs

    Of Wonder, and the wisdom of the World,

    I have essayed, and in my mind there is

    A power to make these subject to itself--

    But they avail not: I have done men good,

    And I have met with good even among men--

    But this availed not: I have had my foes,

    And none have baffled, many fallen before me--                      20

    But this availed not:--Good--or evil--life--

    Powers, passions--all I see in other beings,

    Have been to me as rain unto the sands,

    Since that all-nameless hour. I have no dread,

    And feel the curse to have no natural fear,

    Nor fluttering throb, that beats with hopes or wishes,

    Or lurking love of something on the earth.

    Now to my task.--

                     Mysterious Agency!

    Ye Spirits of the unbounded Universe!

    Whom I have sought in darkness and in light--                       30

    Ye, who do compass earth about, and dwell

    In subtler essence--ye, to whom the tops

    Of mountains inaccessible are haunts,

    And Earth's and Ocean's caves familiar things--

    I call upon ye by the written charm

    Which gives me power upon you--Rise! Appear!

                                                                 ACT III.



             SCENE I.--A Hall in the Castle of Manfred.



                          MANFRED and HERMAN.



     MANFRED.
 What is the hour?



     HERMAN.
                   It wants but one till sunset,

    And promises a lovely twilight.



     MANFRED.
                          Say,

    Are all things so disposed of in the tower

    As I directed?



     HERMAN.
        All, my Lord, are ready:

    Here is the key and casket.



     MANFRED.
                        It is well:

    Thou mayst retire.                                     [Exit HERMAN.]



     MANFRED.
 (alone).     There is a calm upon me--

    Inexplicable stillness! which till now

    Did not belong to what I knew of life.

    If that I did not know Philosophy

    To be of all our vanities the motliest,                             10

    The merest word that ever fooled the ear

    From out the schoolman's jargon, I should deem

    The golden secret, the sought "Kalon," found,

    And seated in my soul. It will not last,

    But it is well to have known it, though but once:

    It hath enlarged my thoughts with a new sense,

    And I within my tablets would note down

    That there is such a feeling. Who is there?



                            [Re-enter HERMAN.]



     HERMAN.
 My Lord, the Abbot of St. Maurice craves

    To greet your presence.



                    [Enter the ABBOT OF ST. MAURICE.]



     ABBOT.
                 Peace be with Count Manfred!              20



     MANFRED.
 Thanks, holy father! welcome to these walls;

    Thy presence honours them, and blesseth those

    Who dwell within them.



     ABBOT.
              Would it were so, Count!--

    But I would fain confer with thee alone.



     MANFRED.
 Herman, retire.--What would my reverend guest?



     ABBOT.
 Thus, without prelude:--Age and zeal--my office--

    And good intent must plead my privilege;

    Our near, though not acquainted neighbourhood,

    May also be my herald. Rumours strange,

    And of unholy nature, are abroad,                                   30

    And busy with thy name--a noble name

    For centuries: may he who bears it now

    Transmit it unimpaired!



     MANFRED.
                  Proceed,--I listen.



     ABBOT.
 'Tis said thou holdest converse with the things

    Which are forbidden to the search of man;

    That with the dwellers of the dark abodes,

    The many evil and unheavenly spirits

    Which walk the valley of the Shade of Death,

    Thou communest. I know that with mankind,

    Thy fellows in creation, thou dost rarely                           40

    Exchange thy thoughts, and that thy solitude

    Is as an Anchorite's--were it but holy.



     MANFRED.
 And what are they who do avouch these things?



     ABBOT.
 My pious brethren--the scaréd peasantry--

    Even thy own vassals--who do look on thee

    With most unquiet eyes. Thy life's in peril!



     MANFRED.
 Take it.



     ABBOT.
        I come to save, and not destroy:

    I would not pry into thy secret soul;

    But if these things be sooth, there still is time

    For penitence and pity: reconcile thee                              50

    With the true church, and through the church to Heaven.



     MANFRED.
 I hear thee. This is my reply--whate'er

    I may have been, or am, doth rest between

    Heaven and myself--I shall not choose a mortal

    To be my mediator--Have I sinned

    Against your ordinances? prove and punish!



     ABBOT.
 My son! I did not speak of punishment,

    But penitence and pardon;--with thyself

    The choice of such remains--and for the last,

    Our institutions and our strong belief                              60

    Have given me power to smooth the path from sin

    To higher hope and better thoughts; the first

    I leave to Heaven,--"Vengeance is mine alone!"

    So saith the Lord, and with all humbleness

    His servant echoes back the awful word.



     MANFRED.
 Old man! there is no power in holy men,

    Nor charm in prayer, nor purifying form

    Of penitence, nor outward look, nor fast,

    Nor agony--nor, greater than all these,

    The innate tortures of that deep Despair,                           70

    Which is Remorse without the fear of Hell,

    But all in all sufficient to itself

    Would make a hell of Heaven--can exorcise

    From out the unbounded spirit the quick sense

    Of its own sins--wrongs--sufferance--and revenge

    Upon itself; there is no future pang

    Can deal that justice on the self--condemned

    He deals on his own soul.



     ABBOT.
                 All this is well;

    For this will pass away, and be succeeded

    By an auspicious hope, which shall look up                          80

    With calm assurafice to that blessed place,

    Which all who seek may win, whatever be

    Their earthly errors, so they be atoned:

    And the commencement of atonement is

    The sense of its necessity. Say on--

    And all our church can teach thee shall be taught;

    And all we can absolve thee shall be pardoned.



     MANFRED.
 When Rome's sixth Emperor was near his last,

    The victim of a self-inflicted wound,

    To shun the torments of a public death                          90

    From senates once his slaves, a certain soldier,

    With show of loyal pity, would have stanched

    The gushing throat with his officious robe;

    The dying Roman thrust him back, and said--

    Some empire still in his expiring glance--

    "It is too late--is this fidelity?"



     ABBOT.
 And what of this?



     MANFRED.
                     I answer with the Roman--

    "It is too late!"



     ABBOT.
           It never can be so,

    To reconcile thyself with thy own soul,

    And thy own soul with Heaven. Hast thou no hope?                   100

    'Tis strange--even those who do despair above,

    Yet shape themselves some fantasy on earth,

    To which frail twig they cling, like drowning men.



     MANFRED.
 Aye--father! I have had those early visions,

    And noble aspirations in my youth,

    To make my own the mind of other men,

    The enlightener of nations; and to rise

    I knew not whither--it might be to fall;

    But fall, even as the mountain-cataract,

    Which having leapt from its more dazzling height,                  110

    Even in the foaming strength of its abyss,

    (Which casts up misty columns that become

    Clouds raining from the re-ascended skies,)

    Lies low but mighty still.--But this is past,

    My thoughts mistook themselves.



     ABBOT.
                         And wherefore so?



     MANFRED.
I could not tame my nature down; for he

    Must serve who fain would sway; and soothe, and sue,

    And watch all time, and pry into all place,

    And be a living Lie, who would become

    A mighty thing amongst the mean--and such                          120

    The mass are; I disdained to mingle with

    A herd, though to be leader--and of wolves,

    The lion is alone, and so am I.



     ABBOT.
 And why not live and act with other men?



     MANFRED.
 Because my nature was averse from life;

    And yet not cruel; for I would not make,

    But find a desolation. Like the Wind,

    The red-hot breath of the most lone Simoom,

    Which dwells but in the desert, and sweeps o'er

    The barren sands which bear no shrubs to blast,                    130

    And revels o'er their wild and arid waves,

    And seeketh not, so that it is not sought,

    But being met is deadly,--such hath been

    The course of my existence; but there came

    Things in my path which are no more.



     ABBOT.
                             Alas!

    I 'gin to fear that thou art past all aid

    From me and from my calling; yet so young,

    I still would----



     MANFRED.
              Look on me! there is an order

    Of mortals on the earth, who do become

    Old in their youth, and die ere middle age,                   140

    Without the violence of warlike death;

    Some perishing of pleasure--some of study--

    Some worn with toil, some of mere weariness,--

    Some of disease--and some insanity--

    And some of withered, or of broken hearts;

    For this last is a malady which slays

    More than are numbered in the lists of Fate,

    Taking all shapes, and bearing many names.

    Look upon me! for even of all these things

    Have I partaken; and of all these things,                          150

    One were enough; then wonder not that I

    Am what I am, but that I ever was,

    Or having been, that I am still on earth.



     ABBOT.
 Yet, hear me still--



     MANFRED.
                        Old man! I do respect

    Thine order, and revere thine years; I deem

    Thy purpose pious, but it is in vain:

    Think me not churlish; I would spare thyself,

    Far more than me, in shunning at this time

    All further colloquy--and so--farewell.

                                                            [Exit MANFRED.]



     ABBOT.
 This should have been a noble creature: he                160

    Hath all the energy which would have made

    A goodly frame of glorious elements,

    Had they been wisely mingled; as it is,

    It is an awful chaos--Light and Darkness--

    And mind and dust--and passions and pure thoughts

    Mixed, and contending without end or order,--

    All dormant or destructive. He will perish--

    And yet he must not--I will try once more,

    For such are worth redemption; and my duty

    Is to dare all things for a righteous end.                         170

    I'll follow him--but cautiously, though surely.

                                                              [Exit ABBOT.]





                      SCENE II.--Another Chamber.



                          MANFRED and HERMAN.



     HERMAN.
 My lord, you bade me wait on you at sunset:

    He sinks behind the mountain.



     MANFRED.
                        Doth he so?

    I will look on him.

                            [MANFRED advances to the Window of the Hall.]

                        Glorious Orb! the idol

    Of early nature, and the vigorous race

    Of undiseased mankind, the giant sons

    Of the embrace of Angels, with a sex

    More beautiful than they, which did draw down

    The erring Spirits who can ne'er return.--

    Most glorious Orb! that wert a worship, ere

    The mystery of thy making was revealed!                             10

    Thou earliest minister of the Almighty,

    Which gladdened, on their mountain tops, the hearts

    Of the Chaldean shepherds, till they poured

    Themselves in orisons! Thou material God!

    And representative of the Unknown--

    Who chose thee for his shadow! Thou chief Star!

    Centre of many stars! which mak'st our earth

    Endurable and temperest the hues

    And hearts of all who walk within thy rays!

    Sire of the seasons! Monarch of the climes,                         20

    And those who dwell in them! for near or far,

    Our inborn spirits have a tint of thee

    Even as our outward aspects;--thou dost rise,

    And shine, and set in glory. Fare thee well!

    I ne'er shall see thee more. As my first glance

    Of love and wonder was for thee, then take

    My latest look: thou wilt not beam on one

    To whom the gifts of life and warmth have been

    Of a more fatal nature. He is gone--

    I follow.                                             [Exit MANFRED.]





       SCENE III.--The Mountains--The Castle of Manfred at some

        distance--A Terrace before a Tower.--Time, Twilight.



            HERMAN, MANUEL, and other dependants of MANFRED.



     HERMAN.
 'Tis strange enough! night after night, for years,

    He hath pursued long vigils in this tower,

    Without a witness. I have been within it,--

    So have we all been oft-times; but from it,

    Or its contents, it were impossible

    To draw conclusions absolute, of aught

    His studies tend to. To be sure, there is

    One chamber where none enter: I would give

    The fee of what I have to come these three years,

    To pore upon its mysteries.



     MANUEL.
                 'Twere dangerous;                        10

    Content thyself with what thou know'st already.



     HERMAN.
 Ah! Manuel! thou art elderly and wise,

    And couldst say much; thou hast dwelt within the castle--

    How many years is't?



     MANUEL.
           Ere Count Manfred's birth,

    I served his father, whom he nought resembles.



     HERMAN.
 There be more sons in like predicament!

    But wherein do they differ?



     MANUEL.
                  I speak not

    Of features or of form, but mind and habits;

    Count Sigismund was proud, but gay and free,--

    A warrior and a reveller; he dwelt not                              20

    With books and solitude, nor made the night

    A gloomy vigil, but a festal time,

    Merrier than day; he did not walk the rocks

    And forests like a wolf, nor turn aside

    From men and their delights.



     HERMAN.
                       Beshrew the hour,

    But those were jocund times! I would that such

    Would visit the old walls again; they look

    As if they had forgotten them.



     MANUEL.
                     These walls

    Must change their chieftain first. Oh! I have seen

    Some strange things in them, Herman.



     HERMAN.
                               Come, be friendly;             30

    Relate me some to while away our watch:

    I've heard thee darkly speak of an event

    Which happened hereabouts, by this same tower.



     MANUEL.
That was a night indeed! I do remember

    'Twas twilight, as it may be now, and such

    Another evening:--yon red cloud, which rests

    On Eigher's pinnacle, so rested then,--

    So like that it might be the same; the wind

    Was faint and gusty, and the mountain snows

    Began to glitter with the climbing moon;                            40

    Count Manfred was, as now, within his tower,--

    How occupied, we knew not, but with him

    The sole companion of his wanderings

    And watchings--her, whom of all earthly things

    That lived, the only thing he seemed to love,--

    As he, indeed, by blood was bound to do,

    The Lady Astarte, his----

                              Hush! who comes here?



                            [Enter the ABBOT.]



     ABBOT.
 Where is your master?



     HERMAN.
                          Yonder in the tower.



     ABBOT.
 I must speak with him.



     MANUEL.
                      'Tis impossible;

    He is most private, and must not be thus                            50

    Intruded on.



     ABBOT.
      Upon myself I take

    The forfeit of my fault, if fault there be--

    But I must see him.



     HERMAN.
              Thou hast seen him once

    his eve already.



     ABBOT.
          Herman! I command thee,

    Knock, and apprize the Count of my approach.



     HERMAN.
 We dare not.



     ABBOT.
            Then it seems I must be herald

    Of my own purpose.



     MANUEL.
         Reverend father, stop--

    I pray you pause.



     ABBOT.
          Why so?



     MANUEL.
                But step this way,

    And I will tell you further.                                [Exeunt.]





                   SCENE IV.--Interior of the Tower.



                             MANFRED alone.



    The stars are forth, the moon above the tops

    Of the snow-shining mountains.--Beautiful!

    I linger yet with Nature, for the Night

    Hath been to me a more familiar face

    Than that of man; and in her starry shade

    Of dim and solitary loveliness,

    I learned the language of another world.

    I do remember me, that in my youth,

    When I was wandering,--upon such a night

    I stood within the Coliseum's wall,                            10

    'Midst the chief relics of almighty Rome;

    The trees which grew along the broken arches

    Waved dark in the blue midnight, and the stars

    Shone through the rents of ruin; from afar

    The watch-dog bayed beyond the Tiber; and

    More near from out the Cæsars' palace came

    The owl's long cry, and, interruptedly,

    Of distant sentinels the fitful song

    Begun and died upon the gentle wind.

    Some cypresses beyond the time-worn breach                          20

    Appeared to skirt the horizon, yet they stood

    Within a bowshot. Where the Cæsars dwelt,

    And dwell the tuneless birds of night, amidst

    A grove which springs through levelled battlements,

    And twines its roots with the imperial hearths,

    Ivy usurps the laurel's place of growth;

    But the gladiators' bloody Circus stands,

    A noble wreck in ruinous perfection,

    While Cæsar's chambers, and the Augustan halls,

    Grovel on earth in indistinct decay.--                              30

    And thou didst shine, thou rolling Moon, upon

    All this, and cast a wide and tender light,

    Which softened down the hoar austerity

    Of rugged desolation, and filled up,

    As 'twere anew, the gaps of centuries;

    Leaving that beautiful which still was so,

    And making that which was not--till the place

    Became religion, and the heart ran o'er

    With silent worship of the Great of old,--

    The dead, but sceptred, Sovereigns, who still rule                  40

    Our spirits from their urns.

                                 'Twas such a night!

    'Tis strange that I recall it at this time;

    But I have found our thoughts take wildest flight

    Even at the moment when they should array

    Themselves in pensive order.



                            [Enter the ABBOT.]



     ABBOT.
                     My good Lord!

    I crave a second grace for this approach;

    But yet let not my humble zeal offend

    By its abruptness--all it hath of ill

    Recoils on me; its good in the effect

    May light upon your head--could I say heart--                      50

    Could I touch that, with words or prayers, I should

    Recall a noble spirit which hath wandered,

    But is not yet all lost.



     MANFRED.
                  Thou know'st me not;

    My days are numbered, and my deeds recorded:

    Retire, or 'twill be dangerous--Away!



     ABBOT.
 Thou dost not mean to menace me?



     MANFRED.
                                   Not I!

    I simply tell thee peril is at hand,

    And would preserve thee.



     ABBOT.
                 What dost thou mean?



     MANFRED.
                                       Look there!

    What dost thou see?



     ABBOT.
           Nothing.



     MANFRED.
                      Look there, I say,

    And steadfastly;--now tell me what thou seest?                      60



     ABBOT.
 That which should shake me,--but I fear it not:

    I see a dusk and awful figure rise,

    Like an infernal god, from out the earth;

    His face wrapt in a mantle, and his form

    Robed as with angry clouds: he stands between

    Thyself and me--but I do fear him not.



     MANFRED.
 Thou hast no cause--he shall not harm thee--but

    His sight may shock thine old limbs into palsy.

    I say to thee--Retire!



     ABBOT.
              And I reply--

    Never--till I have battled with this fiend:--                       70

    What doth he here?



     MANFRED.
             Why--aye--what doth he here?

    I did not send for him,--he is unbidden.



     ABBOT.
 Alas! lost Mortal! what with guests like these

    Hast thou to do? I tremble for thy sake:

    Why doth he gaze on thee, and thou on him?

    Ah! he unveils his aspect: on his brow

    The thunder-scars are graven; from his eye

    Glares forth the immortality of Hell--

    Avaunt!--



     MANFRED.
        Pronounce--what is thy mission?



     SPIRIT.
                                     Come!



     ABBOT.
 What art thou, unknown being? answer!--speak!              80



     SPIRIT.
 The genius of this mortal.--Come!'tis time.



     MANFRED.
 I am prepared for all things, but deny

    The Power which summons me. Who sent thee here?



     SPIRIT.
 Thou'lt know anon--Come! come!



     MANFRED.
                                  I have commanded

    Things of an essence greater far than thine,

    And striven with thy masters. Get thee hence!



     SPIRIT.
 Mortal! thine hour is come--Away! I say.



     MANFRED.
 I knew, and know my hour is come, but not

    To render up my soul to such as thee:

    Away! I'll die as I have lived--alone.                              90



     SPIRIT.
 Then I must summon up my brethren.--Rise!

                                                    [Other Spirits rise.]



     ABBOT.
 Avaunt! ye evil ones!--Avaunt! I say,--

    Ye have no power where Piety hath power,

    And I do charge ye in the name--



     SPIRIT.
                        Old man!

    We know ourselves, our mission, and thine order;

    Waste not thy holy words on idle uses,

    It were in vain: this man is forfeited.

    Once more--I summon him--Away! Away!



     MANFRED.
 I do defy ye,--though I feel my soul

    Is ebbing from me, yet I do defy ye;                               100

    Nor will I hence, while I have earthly breath

    To breathe my scorn upon ye--earthly strength

    To wrestle, though with spirits; what ye take

    Shall be ta'en limb by limb.



     SPIRIT.
                    Reluctant mortal!

    Is this the Magian who would so pervade

    The world invisible, and make himself

    Almost our equal? Can it be that thou

    Art thus in love with life? the very life

    Which made thee wretched?



     MANFRED.
                   Thou false fiend, thou liest!

    My life is in its last hour,--that I know,                       110

    Nor would redeem a moment of that hour;

    I do not combat against Death, but thee

    And thy surrounding angels; my past power

    Was purchased by no compact with thy crew,

    But by superior science--penance, daring,

    And length of watching, strength of mind, and skill

    In knowledge of our Fathers--when the earth

    Saw men and spirits walking side by side,

    And gave ye no supremacy: I stand

    Upon my strength--I do defy--deny--                                120

    Spurn back, and scorn ye!--



     SPIRIT.
                 But thy many crimes

    Have made thee--



     MANFRED.
          What are they to such as thee?

    Must crimes be punished but by other crimes,

    And greater criminals?--Back to thy hell!

    Thou hast no power upon me, that I feel;

    Thou never shalt possess me, that I know:

    What I have done is done; I bear within

    A torture which could nothing gain from thine:

    The Mind which is immortal makes itself

    Requital for its good or evil thoughts,--                          130

    Is its own origin of ill and end--

    And its own place and time: its innate sense,

    When stripped of this mortality, derives

    No colour from the fleeting things without,

    But is absorbed in sufferance or in joy,

    Born from the knowledge of its own desert.

    Thou didst not tempt me, and thou couldst not tempt me;

    I have not been thy dupe, nor am thy prey--

    But was my own destroyer, and will be

    My own hereafter.--Back, ye baffled fiends!                        140

    The hand of Death is on me--but not yours!

                                                  [The Demons disappear.]



     ABBOT.
 Alas! how pale thou art--thy lips are white--

    And thy breast heaves--and in thy gasping throat

    The accents rattle: Give thy prayers to Heaven--

    Pray--albeit but in thought,--but die not thus.



     MANFRED.
 'Tis over--my dull eyes can fix thee not;

    But all things swim around me, and the earth

    Heaves as it were beneath me. Fare thee well--

    Give me thy hand.



     ABBOT.
            Cold--cold--even to the heart--

    But yet one prayer--Alas! how fares it with thee?                  150



     MANFRED.
 Old man! 'tis not so difficult to die.

                                                       [MANFRED expires.]



     ABBOT.
 He's gone--his soul hath ta'en its earthless flight;

    Whither? I dread to think--but he is gone.
